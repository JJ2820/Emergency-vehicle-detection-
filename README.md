# Traffic Management System

*Monitor and control traffic density with vehicle number plate capturing*

## About the Project

The Traffic Management System is designed to monitor and capture traffic density and efficiently operate the traffic lights based on the density. Additionally, the system captures vehicle number plates and stores them with corresponding time logs. This data can be useful for traffic analysis and optimizing traffic flow in different areas.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of traffic density
- Dynamic traffic light control based on traffic density
- Automatic capturing and logging of vehicle number plates
- Data storage for future analysis and record-keeping

## Components

The following components were used in the project:

- Raspberry Pi
- Raspberry Pi Camera Module
- Other hardware components for sensor integration (if applicable)

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

1. Raspberry Pi: You'll need a Raspberry Pi board (such as Raspberry Pi 3 or 4) with Raspbian OS installed.
2. Raspberry Pi Camera Module: Ensure you have a Raspberry Pi Camera Module connected to the Raspberry Pi.

### Installation

#### Example command for installing Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Configuration

- Configure Traffic Management Algorithm: Open the traffic_management.py file and adjust the algorithm parameters according to your traffic conditions and requirements.
- Adjust Camera Settings: If needed, modify the camera settings in the camera.py file to ensure optimal image capture.
- Camera Calibration (Optional): If necessary, perform camera calibration to ensure accurate vehicle number plate recognition.

### Run the System

#### Start the Traffic Management System:
-- python traffic_management.py

The system will now monitor the traffic density and adjust the traffic lights accordingly.

### Accessing Captured Data
- The captured vehicle number plates and time logs will be stored in the data directory.
- Use the data for traffic analysis or further processing as needed.

### Additional Notes
- Make sure to place the Raspberry Pi in a suitable location to capture the traffic efficiently.
- Ensure a stable internet connection for any cloud-based services or remote monitoring.
